title: The daily log
date: 2021-02-26

The idea of keeping a daily log is pretty simple: create a new note as you start
your day and use the date as the name for it. Keep doing that continuously. Be
mindful on patterns in your notes and extract it into some kind of template that
you can reuse. I like that I have a default, there is no need to figure out what
goes where. Just write things down.

Given that the application you use has some core features in place, you can
always branch out as you work into other areas. I might keep a separate note for
the current thing I am working on at work, or adding to my book list as I get a
recommendation. But the default is always the daily log.

As part of my daily routine I have a few key concepts:

1. Migration. Looking back at the last notes, perhaps even the last few.
   Anything that's still not adressed can be copied over
2. Habit stacking on this daily log routine
3. Create a template for the note
